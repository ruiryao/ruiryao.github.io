title: About
---

My name is Rui Yao, or 姚睿 in Chinese. I am currently a research assistant at Synteraction Lab (formerly NUS HCI Lab), the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. Zhao (Shen) Shengdong. Prior to this position, I earned my master's degree (with Distinction) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research interests lie in the interdisciplinary areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Security & Privacy.

Aside from research, I am an amateur half-marathon runner (with awkward timing scores), an idealist poet, a former coffee fanatic, and a food lover. My MBTI type is INFJ-T, and I am eager for opportunities to make new friends.
