***Computational Rationality*** contributes to simulating realistic human behavior, providing designers with advanced insights during the design phase and reducing costs associated with cumbersome human testing.

Efforts have been seen in modeling human behavior. However, existing work does not directly empower non-technical experts to apply Computational Rationality. 

In this paper, we investigate the design of environments that support the interaction between non-technical designers and Computational Rationality.
