On November 24, my adventure began with a journey from Singapore to Shenzhen, marking the start of an unforgettable experience. The following day, I continued my travels from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, embarking on a day filled with excitement and meaningful encounters.

Upon arrival in Hong Kong, one of the first items on my agenda was to activate my IANG visa, which grants me the opportunity to stay and work in this vibrant city for the next two years. With paperwork sorted, I eagerly delved into exploring the city's rich culture and culinary delights.

In the morning, I treated myself to a delectable feast of Satay Beef Noodles and Hong Kong Style Milk Tea at a Southeast Asian canteen. Energized and ready for the day ahead, I then adorned my graduation gown and headed to the congregation, where I reunited with my classmates.

The atmosphere was electric, accompanied by the elegant sound of music as we celebrated our achievements and posed for countless photos. Witnessing the pride and joy on the faces of the PhD graduates, I couldn't help but aspire to join their ranks in the future.

Following the congregation, I received my degree certificate and shared heartfelt moments with friends, expressing gratitude to those who adorned us with beautiful flowers, cuddly bears, and captured memories with their cameras.

For lunch, I indulged in the exquisite flavors of Zhou's Dim Sum House with my dear friend Wang Hongren. Later in the evening, I savored a delightful meal at the Divine Palace of Gastronomy with my former roommates, one of whom is a postdoc at HKU and the other a final year PhD student soon to graduate.

Reflecting on our shared experiences during my master's degree, I couldn't help but feel immense gratitude for their friendship and generosity. Despite my intentions to cover the bill, they insisted on treating me, reaffirming the value of cherished friendships that enrich our lives beyond measure.

As I journeyed back home, I found myself eagerly anticipating our next reunion, cherishing the memories created in the vibrant city of Hong Kong. Each moment, from the bustling streets to the heartfelt conversations, served as a reminder of the beauty of connection and the promise of future adventures. Until we meet again, Hong Kong!
